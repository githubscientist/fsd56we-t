Lets say I want to find the multiple of 2 for each element in an array. => map
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Lets say I want to filter out the elements which are greater than 3. => filter
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [4, 5]

Lets say I want to find the sum of all the elements in an array. => reduce
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15
